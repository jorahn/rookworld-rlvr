## Executive Summary

Work-in-progress implementation of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for fine-tuning RookWorld-LM (GPT-2 124M) to **increase best move accuracy** on the **rookworld_7m dataset**. The system trains on dual tasks: (1) **Policy Task (P:)**: generating structured chess analysis with improved move accuracy, and (2) **Environment Task (A:)**: maintaining chess state prediction correctness.

## Project Goals

### Primary Objective

## Current Limitations & Known Issues

### 🚨 Environment Task Evaluation (Critical Issue)
- **Status**: Environment tasks show 0% success rate during training evaluation
- **Root Cause**: Model generates incorrect move sequences in environment task responses
- **Technical Details**: 
  - Pre-trained RookWorld-LM model generates correct environment format in standalone tests
  - During training evaluation, model produces wrong moves (e.g., generates "e2e4" when prompted with "g1h3")
  - Pipeline fixes applied: EOS token handling, attention masks, token limits (64→80)
- **Impact**: Environment task training data may be learning from incorrect labels
- **Workaround**: Use policy-only training (`--mix-env-ratio 0.0`) until resolved
- **Issue**: [#10](https://github.com/jorahn/rookworld-rlvr/issues/10) - Detailed technical investigation needed

### ⚠️ Training Stability 
- **Status**: Improved but not fully stable for production use
- **Challenges**: 
  - KL divergence can spike unexpectedly (>20) causing training instability
  - High gradient clipping rates (100%) indicate optimization difficulties
  - Recovery system helps but doesn't prevent underlying instability
- **Progress**: Mixed task training prevents 46% of divergence cases
- **Recommendations**: Monitor KL divergence closely, use conservative learning rates (1e-6)

### 🚀 Future Research Directions
1. **Curriculum Learning**: Progressive difficulty using dataset structure
2. **Multi-Dataset Support**: Integration with additional chess datasets  
3. **Advanced Optimizations**: Flash Attention, vLLM integration (2-5x speedup potential)
4. **Search Integration**: MCTS with learned policy priors

### System Requirements & Scaling

**Recommended Hardware**:
- **GPU**: RTX 4090 (24GB VRAM) - verified optimal performance
- **RAM**: 32GB+ for dataset handling
- **Storage**: 100GB+ for checkpoints and dataset cache

**Single-GPU Focus**: The 124M parameter model is efficiently trained on single RTX 4090. Multi-GPU support would require significant architectural changes and is not needed for this model size.

**Performance Scaling**:
- **Model Size**: 124M parameters (optimal for single GPU)
- **Dataset Size**: 6.96M samples (handled efficiently with streaming)
- **Training Speed**: 4-5x speedup achieved with optimizations
- **Memory Efficiency**: 12-16GB peak usage (50-65% of RTX 4090)

## Troubleshooting

### Critical Implementation Issues

**Training Divergence/Instability**:
- ✅ **Root Cause**: Policy-only training causes catastrophic divergence
- ✅ **Solution**: Use `mix_env_ratio=0.2` (20% environment tasks)
- ✅ **Fix Applied**: Mixed task training prevents 46% of divergence

**Target Detection Errors**:
- ✅ **Root Cause**: 'M:' tokenizes as two tokens (' M' + ':')
- ✅ **Solution**: Fixed in `policy.py:336-359` with multi-token detection
- ✅ **Verification**: Target indices now correctly at position 46

### Common Training Issues

**Low Best Move Accuracy**:
- Increase dataset mixing ratio to 0.8-0.9 for more real data
- Verify Stockfish analysis is working correctly
- Check reward computation for policy tasks

**GPU Memory Issues (RTX 4090)**:
- Enable mixed precision: `--mixed-precision`
- Reduce batch size: `--batch-positions 8`
- Use gradient checkpointing (implemented)

**NaN Losses**:
- ✅ **Automatic Recovery**: System handles NaN with learning rate reduction
- ✅ **Resume Training**: Use `--auto-resume` to continue from last stable checkpoint
- Monitor KL divergence - large values (>5.0) trigger automatic adjustment
