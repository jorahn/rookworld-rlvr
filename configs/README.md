# Configuration Files

This directory contains YAML configuration files for different training scenarios:

- `sft_warmup.yaml`: SFT warmup configuration
- `self_play_only.yaml`: Self-play only training
- `engine_mix.yaml`: Mixed self-play and engine guidance
- `high_performance.yaml`: High-performance training settings

Configuration files will be added as part of the hardening implementation.
